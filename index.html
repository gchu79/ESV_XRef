    So much in these passages deserves our attention.
    </br></br>
    Look at the unity of the Trinity. The Son will ask the Father, and the Father will send the Spirit. There is a happy cooperation at work here as if to say all of heaven sends help in the direction of the disciples of Jesus.

    Also take note of the pronoun. Jesus doesn't want us to think of the Holy Spirit as an it or a thing. The Spirit is a person. And, like a person, the Spirit has intellect, emotions, and will. The Spirit speaks to the churches (Rev. 2:7), intercedes for the believer (Rom. 8:26), leads and commands the disciples (Acts 8:29; 16:6-7). The Spirit appoints elders (Acts 20:28), searches all things (1 Cor. 2:10), knows the mind of God (1 Cor. 2:11), and teaches the content of the gospel to us (1 Cor. 2:13). The Spirit dwells among and within believers (1 Cor. 3:16; Rom. 8:11; 2 Tim. 1:14), distributes spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 12:11), and gives life to those who believe (2 Cor. 3:6). He cries out from within our hearts (Gal. 4:6) and leads us in the ways of God (Gal. 5:18). He helps us in our weaknesses (Rom. 8:26), works all things together for our ultimate good (Rom. 8:28 THE MESSAGE), and strengthens believers (Eph. 3:16). He can be lied to (Acts 5:3-4), grieved (Eph. 4:30), insulted (Heb. 10:29), and blasphemed (Matt. 12:31-32).
